# LED mosaic

![Mosaic result](https://www.justin-silver.com/assets/img/ledmosaic/result.png)

This project was inspired by the following post from [Nick Loomis](https://loomsci.wordpress.com/2013/06/19/segmented-display-images/). The idea is to create a [photomosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic) built from those little 7-segment digit displays that you commonly find on microwaves, ovens, etc.
